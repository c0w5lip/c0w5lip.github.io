    <h1 id="about-this">About this</h1>
<p>I did some challenges from the <a href="https://france-cybersecurity-challenge.fr/">France Cybersecurity Challenge</a> of this year, so here just 2 write ups (cuz I may not be really good at explaining how to solve shit). I didn&rsquo;t solved any tricky chall due to my lack of implication in the CTF, but some of them were pretty fun though, so thanks to the organizers.</p>
<p>I finished 618/1364 on global ranking, and 67/188 on junior ranking.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some addition:
What is 7381 + 8074 ?
Oh yeah, I think I forgot to mention. As an extra bonus to make sure you are learning, these numbers change every second :)
Tee hee! Good luck keeping up!</p>

<p>We first encounter a page that ask us to compute an addition on random numbers in less than a second. We&rsquo;ll obviously code a script that scrap the page, compute the addition, and send back the result in the submit.</p>

<p>Sincere acknowledgements to <a href="http://aassfxxx.infos.st/">aaSSfxxx</a> who helped me a bit with mathematical demonstrations and kindly read my write up before I posted it.</p>
<p>This challenge is one of the ones I flagged during the <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1774/">IrisCTF 2023</a>. Thanks to the organizers, I didn&rsquo;t tried lots challenges but that one was particulary fun as a beginner.</p>

<p>Everyone knows RSA, but everyone also knows that RSA is slow. Why not just use a faster operation than exponentiation?</p>
